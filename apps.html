    <h1>
        <strong>Welcome to my Apps Tab</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>This is my final project tab! The final project I did was created by me and my partner Lisandro Torres. It's an entertainment game that allows the user to play an endless game that continues to rack up the score while going past tubes. It's fairly similar to a game you probably remember from a few years ago. To start the game, the user must click the button labelled "Start". Once this is pressed, the scene changes to the game screen and it immediately starts to move the tubes toward the bitmoji character. The user must avoid the tubes by presssing any button on there keyboard. If a tube is touched, it will prompt the end game screen saying how many tubes you passed and that the game is over.</p>
