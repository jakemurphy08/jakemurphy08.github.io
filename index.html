    <h1>
        <strong>Welcome to Jake's Page</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>My name is Jake Murphy. This is my first ever website I have created on my own through HTML. The home button will take you back to this screen. The Javascripts button will show the Java programs I have created. The Apps button will show the Apps I have created. Lastly, the About Me tab will show stuff about the creator of this page; me. This website is just being started and will be strategically updated during the next few months! I hope you enjoy your experience here!</p>
